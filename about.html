            Alongside our generator, we provide a convenient way to query your old passwords to analyze whether or not
            your password has been breached in the past or if it is safe to use.
            Our program provides these key points:

        <!-- Pwned Passwords API Section -->
        <div class="dashboard-item">
            <h1>Pwned Passwords API</h1>
            <p>Pwned Passwords are a collection of passwords that have been exposed in data breaches. This service allows you to check if your password has been compromised by querying a database of hashed passwords.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <strong>API Functionality:</strong> The Pwned Passwords API uses a k-Anonymity model to protect the value of the source password. Only the first 5 characters of the SHA-1 hash are sent to the API, and the response contains all matching hashes with their breach counts. You can then check if your full hash is among the returned results.
                <br>
                <strong>How to Use:</strong> To check a password, send the first 5 characters of its SHA-1 hash to the following endpoint:
                <br>
                <code>GET https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/{first 5 hash chars}</code>
                <br>
                If a matching hash is found, the API responds with the suffixes and breach counts. This allows you to determine if your password has been compromised without exposing it.
